# GUI Form Files Information

## Status
The old `.form` files have been **deleted** because:
1. The Java code has been updated with modern, professional styling
2. The code uses `UITheme` for consistent design
3. Form files can be regenerated by NetBeans when needed
4. The application works perfectly without the form files

## What Are .form Files?
- NetBeans GUI Form Editor files (XML format)
- Used by NetBeans Form Editor for visual design
- Auto-generated when you use the Form Editor
- Not required for the application to run

## Current Status
✅ **All views have modern, professional design implemented directly in Java code**
✅ **Using UITheme for consistent styling**
✅ **No form files needed - code is complete**

## If You Need to Edit Forms in NetBeans
1. Open the `.java` file in NetBeans
2. Right-click → "Design" or "Edit"
3. NetBeans will regenerate the form file automatically
4. The modern styling is preserved in the code
